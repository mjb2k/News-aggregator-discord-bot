# News-aggregator-discord-bot
This bot is a news aggregator I made for my discord server. 
It uses web scraping to find relevant articles on a topic, or if the user wishes the top headlines of the day. 
It also has a scheduling command which can be used to schedule its commands to happen at certain times of the day. 

Requires safari. 

To get list of commands say .newsinfo into a chat the bot has access to.
